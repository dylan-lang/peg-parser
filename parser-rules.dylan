/**          
FUNCTION: Rule parser
---------------------
IN MODULE: peg-parser:peg-parser
SYNOPSIS: A function that partially parses a stream according to a rule.

Rule parsers are created by the 'seq', 'choice', 'many', 'opt', 'opt-seq',
'opt-choice', 'opt-many', 'req-next', 'not-next', and 'nil' functions used in
'parser-definer' macros. They may also be created manually for efficiency or to
support special behaviors via the 'parser-method-definer' macro.

Rule parsers must be named "parse-something" to work with the 'parser-definer'
macro. If the parser fails to match or reaches end-of-stream, it must return #f
for the 'product' and 'success?' values and roll back the position of the stream
so that another parser may be tried.

If the parser fails to match, it must return an instance of '<parse-failure>'
describing the expected or unexpected element that caused the parser to fail.

If the parser succeeds, it may return an instance of '<parse-success>' or
'<parse-failure>'. It should return an instance of '<parse-failure>' to describe
errors that arose while parsing, but from which the parser backtracked and
recovered. If there were no parse errors, recovered or otherwise, then the
parser should return '<parse-success>'. Parse errors should be combined with
'combine-extents'.

Conceptually, '<parse-failure>' instances describe why a parser did not parse
further than it did. If all parsers ultimately fail to match, one of these
errors indicated a possible root cause. '<Parse-success>' instances describe the
furthest the parser has parsed and are only relevant for 'not-next' parsers.

All these behaviors are implemented automatically when using
'parser-method-definer' or 'parser-definer' macros or the 'seq' etc. functions.

ARGUMENTS:
   stream   - An instance of '<positionable-stream>'.
   context  - A context object.

VALUES:
   product     - An instance of '<sequence>', #f, or some other value
                 (usually an instance of '<token>'), depending on the
                 parser's rule(s). #f indicates no stream elements were
                 consumed or the token was not present.
   success?    - An instance of '<boolean>', indicating whether the parser
                 succeeded. Parsers may succeed even if no product results.
   extent      - An instance of '<parse-extent>'.
